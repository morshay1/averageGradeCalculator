# How to enter your grades:
# Format for each line:
#   <Course Name> <Grade (0-100)> <Nakaz (weight factor)>
# Please follow this format for each course.
# Lines starting with '#' are considered comments and will be ignored by the system.
# To ensure the system can read your data, remove any '#' characters from the beginning of the line.



# Example: (remove the # at the beginning of each row)
# english 600 2
# statistics 66 3.5




# **Important Note about "עובד בינארי" (Binary Pass)**
# If your grade is "עובד בינארי" (Binary Pass), this means the grade is greater than 100.
# For example, if your grade is 600, you should enter it as "600" in the grade column.
# The system knows how to handle grades greater than 100, so there is no need to make any adjustments.
